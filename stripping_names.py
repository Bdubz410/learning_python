# Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions.
# lstrip(), rstrip(), & strip().

name = " kaeden primavera "
print(name.lstrip())
print(name.rstrip())
print(name.strip())  # Best to do this in **Linux** to see whitespaces
