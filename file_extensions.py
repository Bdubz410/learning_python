# Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix().
# Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename.
# Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extentions, like some file browsers do.
# **Write code here and use the LINUX pycharm to practice creating file**
filename = 'python_notes.txt'
filename.removesuffix('.txt')
print(filename.removesuffix('.txt'))
