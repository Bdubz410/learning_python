# Using get() to access values.
# Using keys in square brackets to retrieve the value you're interested in from a
# dictionary might cause one potential problem:
# if the key you ask for doesn't exist, you'll get an error.

# You can use the get() method to set a default value that will be returned
# if the requested key doesn't exist.
# The get() method requires a key as a first argument.
# As a second optional argument, you can pass the value to be returned if the key doesn't exist:
alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed': 'slow'}
