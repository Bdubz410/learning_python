I started learning some Python in my cybersecurity course. We did not delve too deep into it; I was intrigued to learn more so I purchased a few books to get a better understanding of Python and learn to code.
The code located in this repository contains all of the practice .py files that I have completed from the, Python Crash Course, book I have been using to learn Python.
I am about halfway through the book and intend on adding more code as I advance through my studies.
In more detail the topics that were covered are as follows:
Variables and Simple Data Types, Introduction to Lists, Working with Lists, Tuples, Styling Code, If Statements, Errors, Dictionaries, For Loops, While Loops, User Input,
Functions, Classes, Files and Exceptions, and Testing Code.
