# Write a series of conditional tests.
# Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test.
# Your code should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')

# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')

# Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
# Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
