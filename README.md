I started learning some Python in my cybersecurity course. We did not delve too deep into it; I was intrigued to learn more so I purchased a few books to get a better understanding of Python and learn to code.
The code located in this branch of my repository contains all of the practice .py files that I have completed from the, Python Crash Course, book I have been using to learn Python.
I am about halfway through the book and intend on adding more code as I advance through my studies.
