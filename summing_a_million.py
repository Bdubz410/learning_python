# Make a list of the numbers from one to one million, and then use min() and max() to make sure your list actually starts at one and ends at one million.
# Also, use the sum() function to see how quickly Python can add a million numbers.

# Did this in the terminal
# digits = list(range(1, 1000001))
# min(digits) 1
# max(digits) 1000000
# sum(digits) 500000500000 **why did I get this sum?**

# Copilot says...The result you obtained, 500000500000, is the sum of all the integers from 1 to 1,000,000 (inclusive). Let’s break down why this is the correct answer:
#
# Sum of Integers from 1 to 1,000,000:
#
# The sum of integers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula:Sum=2n⋅(n+1)​
#
# In your case, n is 1,000,000:Sum=21000000⋅(1000000+1)​=500000500000
#
#
#
#
# So, the result you obtained is indeed the correct sum of integers from 1 to 1,000,000
